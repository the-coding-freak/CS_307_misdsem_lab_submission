----------------------------------------
Analysis (Theoretical & Practical)
----------------------------------------
Search Space:       140 total unique states.

Optimality:
 - BFS guarantees the shortest path because it explores level by level.
 - DFS finds a path but doesn't guarantee it's the shortest.

Performance Metrics:
           | States Visited | Max Memory Used
------------------------------------------------
BFS        | {bfs_visited:<15}| {bfs_max_queue:<15}
DFS        | {dfs_visited:<15}| {dfs_max_stack:<15}

Conclusion:
For this problem, BFS is preferred as it guarantees the 15-step
optimal solution. The numerical results show that DFS was more
memory-efficient (smaller max stack), but BFS was more time-
efficient (fewer states visited to find the optimal path).
